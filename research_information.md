⚙️ Common SaaS Company Structures
1. Functional Structure (Early Stage)
Teams: Engineering, Product, Sales, Marketing, CS

Use Case: When the company is still small and roles are siloed.

Example: One team owns all of “engineering,” one team owns “sales,” etc.

2. Cross-Functional Product Teams
Structure: PM + Engineers + Designer + (sometimes Data/QA) per product area.

Inspired by: Spotify Squads model.

Goal: Autonomy, faster iteration, and domain ownership.

Use Case: When products are becoming modular or you need to scale.

3. Value Stream Organization (aka Value Creation Teams)
Structure: Teams are organized around value streams — customer journeys, product features, or business KPIs.

Team Examples:

“Onboarding Acceleration VCT”

“Renewal Optimization VCT”

“Developer Experience VCT”

Outcome Focused: VCTs are measured by value delivered (e.g. activation rate, retention, NRR), not just feature output.

4. Platform & Enablement Teams
Structure: Internal-facing teams that empower product teams.

Examples:

DevEx (Developer Experience)

Infra/Platform Engineering

AI/ML Foundation team

Design Systems

Goal: Provide reusable tooling, systems, and abstractions.

5. Customer Journey Teams (Stage-Based)
Structure: Teams aligned by lifecycle stages.

Acquisition

Activation

Retention

Expansion

Great for: Product-led growth (PLG) orgs or when aligning product with GTM is essential.

🧠 Internal Frameworks Used in SaaS Orgs
These are often layered atop those structures to guide decisions, planning, and execution:

🔹 1. VCT (Value Creation Team) Model
Core Concept: Teams map to parts of the product that drive measurable customer/business value.

Each VCT Has:

Charter/mission tied to a business outcome

KPIs (e.g. reduce churn, increase trials to paid conversion)

Autonomy to execute across UX, engineering, ops

🔹 2. R&D Taxonomy: Core / Growth / Innovation
Core = Keep the engine running (reliability, infra)

Growth = Optimize the funnel (activation, retention)

Innovation = New bets (AI features, new markets)

🔹 3. Team Topologies (by Matthew Skelton)
Team Types:

Stream-aligned

Enabling

Complicated-subsystem

Platform

Used to design healthy, modular orgs with clear ownership boundaries.

🔹 4. Outcome vs Output Model
Shift teams to be evaluated on impact metrics (customer retention, time to value) instead of just shipping features.

Encourages ownership, experimentation, and measurement.

🔹 5. OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
Every team has quarterly objectives tied to company-level goals.

Common for aligning VCTs or Product Pods around outcomes.

🔹 6. North Star Metric Framework
Each team (or product) has one metric that best reflects sustainable growth.

E.g.:

Slack: messages sent per org

Dropbox: number of files backed up

VCTs often own a North Star Metric

🧭 Example: SaaS Org at Scale
Example SaaS Org with VCT structure might look like:

Team Name	Type	Primary Metric
Onboarding VCT	Value Creation	Activation rate
Retention VCT	Value Creation	90-day retention
AI Platform	Platform	Model deployment velocity
Developer Tools	Enablement	CI/CD pipeline success rate
Analytics Core	Core Infra	Data latency < X ms
Billing & Payments	Functional / Shared Services	Billing error rate

🪜 How This Evolves Over Time
Stage	Structure
1–10 people	Functional teams
10–50	Cross-functional pods
50–150	Add VCTs + enablement teams
150+	Split into product lines, establish platform teams, deeply matrixed orgs
